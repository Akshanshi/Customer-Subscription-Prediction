# Customer Subscription Prediction with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates to predict if the clint will subscribe a term deposit(yes/no)

## Dataset
The dataset you will be using is the Bank Marketing dataset: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing, which contains 
information about customers of a Portuguese bank who were contacted by 
telemarketers about a term deposit
## Requirements
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Operating system
- numpy
- seaborn
-sklearn 

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
- git clone <repository_url>

2. Install the required dependencies:
-pip install matplotlib ,pandas ,numpy ,seaborn ,sklearn

3. Run the script: Customer Subscription Prediction

4. Training Process
- The script loads the dataset and performs data preprocessing.
- A convolutional neural network model based on InceptionV3 is defined.
- The model is trained on the training set with validation performed on the validation set.
- Training progress, including accuracy and loss, is displayed.

5. Evaluation
- The trained model is evaluated on the test set.
- Test accuracy and loss are reported.

6. Saving the Model
- The trained model is saved to the "Customer Subscription Prediction" directory.

## Files
- `Customer Subscription Prediction`: The main Python script for training and evaluating the model.
- `README.md`: This file providing detailed information about the project.
- `Customer Subscription Prediction/`: Directory containing the saved model.
